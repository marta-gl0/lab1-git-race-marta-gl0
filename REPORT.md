# Lab 1 Git Race -- Project Report

## Description of Changes
The aspects that have been implemented in this practice are the following:

**- Time-based greeting:** When the buttons *Test Web Page* or *Test /api/hello* are pressed, a greeting is generated based on the current time. This greeting can be *Good Morning*, *Good Afternoon* or *Good Evening*. Specifically:  
  - Between 7:00 and 13:00 → *Good Morning*  
  - Between 14:00 and 20:00 → *Good Afternoon*  
  - At other times → *Good Evening*

**- Dark/Light mode:** A new button has been added to the navigation bar to toggle between dark and light themes. Clicking the button switches the theme, adapting the entire user interface accordingly. Thanks to local storage, the last selected theme is preserved even if the server is stopped and restarted.

**- Greeting History:** Users can view the last 50 greetings generated on the server, each with its corresponding timestamp. Whenever a greeting is created, it is stored in an array that serves as the history. Note that when the server is stopped and restarted, the array is cleared, due to the lack of persistance in the server (there is no database).

**- Reactive controller migration:** The *HelloController* has been converted to a reactive implementation using Kotlin coroutines / Spring WebFlux. Controller handlers are now implemented as suspend functions. This change improves concurrency and prepares the app for higher throughput in asynchronous scenarios.

**- Gatling load tests:** Performance/load tests using Gatling have been added targeting the /api/history endpoint. The Gatling simulation stresses the history endpoint to measure response times, throughput and how the application behaves under concurrent requests that read/write greeting history. This Gatling script is included in the project (under src/gatling/kotlin/com).

**- Github Actions:** The existing tests have been updated to reflect the modifications made to the controllers. Additionally, new tests have been created for the new greeting history controller. The project is prepared so Gatling scenarios can be executed as part of performance test stages in CI.

**- OpenAPI documentation:** Springdoc has been added as a dependency to enable Swagger documentation. All endpoints of the REST controllers (*HelloApiController* and *HistoryApiController*) have been documented using annotations in the code. This documentation can be accessed at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## Technical Decisions

**- WebFlux / Reactive approach:** Converting the controllers to a reactive, coroutine-based implementation (Spring WebFlux + Kotlin coroutines) was chosen to allow more efficient handling of concurrent requests and to avoid blocking threads when performing many small, fast operations (such as generating greetings and appending to an in-memory history).

**- Gatling for load testing:** Gatling was chosen for load/performance testing because of its strong reporting, and good integration with Gradle/GitHub Actions. The Gatling scenario targets /api/history to exercise both reads of the history and the implicit concurrent writes generated by many simultaneous greeting requests, giving insight into latency and throughput characteristics.

**- Swagger / OpenAPI:** Given the experience and successful use of Swagger/OpenAPI in previous projects, this standard was adopted once again for API documentation. Its implementation promotes consistency, leverages existing team knowledge, and minimizes the onboarding time for new developers.

## Learning Outcomes

**Kotlin & Spring Boot**
- Incorporated Kotlin into a project for the first time, gaining practical experience with this technology.
- Explored how Spring Boot organizes applications using Controllers, to process HTTP requests and generate responses.
- Migrated classical MVC controller code to a reactive, coroutine-based style (Spring WebFlux + Kotlin coroutines), learning about suspend handlers, non-blocking semantics and considerations around shared mutable state in a concurrent environment.

**Server-Side Web Development**
- Acquired knowledge on building server-rendered applications using Spring Boot in combination with Thymeleaf.
- Practiced integrating backend functionality directly into frontend templates, rather than adopting a fully decoupled frontend-backend structure.
- Learned how reactive controllers interact with template rendering and how to adapt integration tests accordingly.

**Testing**
- Strengthened understanding of different testing strategies and their objectives:
  - MockMvc / WebTestClient Tests: Evaluating controller behavior without deploying a full server (WebTestClient used for reactive endpoints).
  - Integration Tests: Verifying interactions across multiple layers of the system.
  - Performance Tests: Added Gatling simulations to exercise /api/history under load, measuring latency, throughput and spotting concurrency-related issues.
  - Adapted test tooling for WebFlux and coroutines to ensure robust verification of reactive behavior.

## AI Disclosure
### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT

### AI-Assisted Work

**- Describe what was generated with AI assistance:** All the KDoc documentation and the OpenAPI/Swagger annotations added to *HelloController.kt*; the implemented modifications and newly added tests under *src/main/test*; and the additional CSS rules introduced in *styles.css* and guidance for the Gatling simulation that stresses */api/history*.

**- Percentage of AI-assisted vs. original work:** Approximately 50% AI-assisted / 50% human-authored and reviewed. All the AI generated initial KDoc blocks, OpenAPI annotations, test/style scaffolding and Gatling scenario suggestions were reviewed, corrected, completed and integrated successfully.

**- Any modifications made to AI-generated code:**
  - Content corrections in KDoc blocks (clarified summaries).
  - Import reordering, formatting adjustments and minor refactorings to satisfy project linting and style rules.
  - Hardening and completion of generated tests (additional assertions, fixtures and teardown/cleanup).
  - Refinement of CSS selectors and rules to ensure visual consistency and prevent regressions with the existing design system.
  - Integration adjustments to ensure the generated artifacts build and run within the project's CI pipeline.
  - Validation and adaptation of Gatling scenario to the actual endpoint behavior and project structure.

### Original Work

**- Core application logic:** Implemented significant changes within controllers and the business layer to refine and enhance the application’s functionality.

**- Learning Process:** Gained practical experience with Kotlin and Spring Boot’s layered architecture, testing workflows through GitHub Actions, and performance testing with Gatling. This learning was reinforced by actively integrating and adapting AI-driven recommendations into the project.
